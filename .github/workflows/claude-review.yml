            Review this pull request for the MacCleans.sh project (a macOS cleanup shell script).
            Focus on:
            - Bugs that could cause incorrect behavior at runtime
            - Security vulnerabilities (this script can run with sudo privileges)
            - Correctness of file paths and shell commands
            - Shell scripting best practices (quoting, error handling, portability)

            Only flag HIGH SIGNAL issues — objective bugs and clear security problems.
            Do not flag nitpicks, style preferences, or speculative concerns.
