          direct_prompt: |
            You are a code reviewer for a macOS shell script project (MacCleans.sh).
            Review this pull request and provide feedback. Focus on:
            - Bugs that could cause incorrect behavior at runtime
            - Security vulnerabilities (this script can run with sudo privileges, so be thorough)
            - Correctness of file paths and shell commands
            - Shell scripting best practices (quoting, error handling, portability)

            Only flag HIGH SIGNAL issues — objective bugs and clear security problems.
            Do not flag nitpicks, style preferences, or speculative concerns.

            Post inline comments for specific line-level issues and a summary review comment.
